# Lesson 2

Java file handling practice using Scanner

## 1) [Read text file with the scanner](./Read.java) - [Test](../../../test/java/lesson02/ReadTest.java)

Read coordinate from the input file and print out the one **closest** to the center `(0, 0)`

## 2) [Read and Print](./Print.java)

Read coordinates and print out a **10 by 10** plane, put `X` where is a coordinate and `.` where's not.

## 3) [Ships](./Ships.java)

Read ships from a file, then attacks from another. Simulate a one-sided torpedo game. Print out the table after each attack and the statuses of the ships (Total health and health remaining).
Mark empty spots on the **10 by 10** plane with a `.`, Ships with a `-` or `|` depending on where it's facing and damaged parts of the ships with a `#`.
